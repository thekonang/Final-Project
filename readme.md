# Data Science Project: Retail Sales Analysis

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a fictional retail company's sales data. The goal is to apply data cleaning, descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, data visualization, and predictive modeling techniques to gain insights into sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance.

## Dataset Description

The dataset `adjusted_retail_sales_data_v2.csv` includes the following columns:

- `SalesDate`: Date of the sale (YYYY-MM-DD).
- `ProductCategory`: Category of the product (Clothing, Electronics, Home Appliances).
- `SalesAmount`: Sales amount in USD.
- `CustomerAge`: Age of the customer (Categorical).
- `CustomerGender`: Gender of the customer (Male, Female, Non-binary).
- `CustomerLocation`: Location of the customer (Japan, Australia, India, USA, UK, Canada).
- `ProductRatings`: Product rating (1 to 5).

# Prerequisites
